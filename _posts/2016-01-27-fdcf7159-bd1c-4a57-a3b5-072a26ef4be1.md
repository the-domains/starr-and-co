Turning on the television we're faced with news stories that truly challenge our conscience and sense of social responsibility. It provokes the question, "What can I possibly do to make a difference?"

STARR & CO shares your feelings. Motivated by our desire to help in our own small way we are determined to make the world a better place.  We hope to achieve this by creating exquisite jewellery with a social contribution.

STARR & CO jewellery connects charity to the sale of each unique piece. Collaborating directly with charities whose mission is to help vulnerable children in need, we hope to make that difference.  The charity revenue raised from each individual STARR & CO sale, goes directly to projects we've researched, identified and believe in.  These global partnerships are crucial to the spirit of STARR & CO jewellery.

Our mission is that every piece of STARR & CO jewellery sold, be it to individuals, celebrities or corporate clients, raises funds for the charities and projects we support.  We donate no less than _25% _of the purchase price from _every _piece sold to specific projects from building Yurts in Mongolia, medical and education in Vietnam, early childhood development of deaf and hard of hearing children in India and housing, education and employment in the UK.  When you purchase jewellery from STARR & CO you'll see exactly which organisation you'll help. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/25bba0a0-5f30-4193-88e9-92552226c1b4.jpg)

It's a great feeling when you know you've done something so personally pleasurable that also makes the world just a tiny bit better. At STARR & CO we get that feeling whenever we design and create a new line of jewellery. You'll get the same feeling just by buying a piece, whether for yourself or a loved one.
